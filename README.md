# ApSpace Discord Bot
Stay up to date with your APU auto-scheduled timetable when you are chilling in your Discord server!

## ü§îWhy create this bot?
The main reason why I wanted to automate this is because my parent will always chase me for weekly timetable updates... I will always hear questions like "Is the timetable still the same as last week?", "What time is your class starting for tomorrow?" although clearly I have already written the schedule in a WhatsApp group, I will still be chased for latest updates... They complained that screenshots are too difficult to read, so the only way to keep them updated is by manually typing out the timetables weekly. I have been doing this manually for the past 2 years of my Diploma studies. But I thought, why do it manually if I can make an automation to do it for me? I'm a Software Engineering student myself, I built bots for my clients as freelance... Why not make something that makes my life easier once and for all? So this is where APSpace Discord Bot comes into place. Your family members surely do not have access to an ApSpace account, but what they do have is your contact such as WhatsApp and Discord. 

## ‚öôÔ∏èMain Features
To make the bot easier to use, I have prepared a few functions for the bot.

- [ ] Ability to remember your intake code and send timetable based on that.
- [ ] Automatically send weekly and daily timetables on schedule.
- [ ] Ability to query timetable by date (by intake code)
- [ ] Ability to query timetable by weekdays (by intake code)
- [ ] Ability to query timetable by module code (by intake code)
- [ ] Ability to find empty classrooms by room number (e.g. B-06-12, E-09-02, etc)
