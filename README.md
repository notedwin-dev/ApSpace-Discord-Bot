## ü§î Why Create This Bot?

The main reason why I wanted to automate this is because my parent will always chase me for weekly timetable updates... 

I will always hear questions like ***"Is the timetable still the same as last week?"***, ***"What time is your class starting for tomorrow?"***, although clearly I have already written the schedule in a WhatsApp group, I will still be chased for latest updates... 

They complained that **screenshots are too difficult to read**, so the only way to keep them updated is by **manually typing out the timetables weekly**. I have been doing this **manually** for the **past 2 years of my Diploma studies**. 

But I thought, why do it manually if I can make an automation to do it for me? I'm a Software Engineering student myself, I built bots for my clients as freelance... 

So why not build something that could ***make my life easier once and for all?*** And this is where **ApSpace Discord Bot** comes into place. Your family members surely do not have access to an ApSpace account, but what they do have is your contact such as WhatsApp and Discord.

### FAQ

#### How do I search for specific rooms?
- **Auditoriums**: You can search using any of these formats:
  - `/timetable room Audi 1`
  - `/timetable room Auditorium 1`
  - `/timetable room Auditorium 1 @ Level 6`
  All these will find the same room.

- **Tech Labs**: Similarly flexible search:
  - `/timetable room Tech Lab 4-03`
  - `/timetable room TLab 4-03`

- **Regular Rooms**: Use the standard format:
  - `/timetable room B-06-12`

The search is case-insensitive and smart enough to match rooms even with additional location information.
